Bio: 
I’m an Interaction Designer with a focus on information visualization and interface design. With my work, I explore opportunities to innovate through the combination of design and technology, to simplify complex data in order to raise awareness, comprehension and engagement, and to tell stories with an open intent and meaningful impact. My research and work interests center around persuasive technology, information and knowledge visualization and emerging interaction principles between humans and machines.
