Cultural entrepreneur vs. poetic entrepreneur

If the focus for a business is growth, then size, market share, competitiveness, efficiency are the right measures. We have never felt that this is the right thing for us. We have never thought that way. The focus of Interactive Things is to become a place where real problems get solved. By real people. With a real dedication for improving the world around us. 

Yes, that’s how poetic we get when talking about entrepreneurship.

Some clients are confused when we tell them upfront that we wouldn’t work with them. That we wouldn’t make it possible in their planned timeline. That we wouldn’t work within this budget. That we wouldn’t twist the content to tell their story. I know that the people working in this room would get confused if I told them that we would.

The excitement for the fast, and the desire for the slow.

We now feel just as comfortable pushing this studio forward than we are pushing pixels around or git commits.

Real people hire for attitude and not for skill. Everything that isn’t there yet can be learned. Changing at heart is difficult.

For me this feels grown up. 
Or growing up at least.

It must be so nice to be able to have, you know, built something that can live in a place like this. I supposed that’s a weird way of saying it, but I think you know what I mean. I do know what she meant. I can’t say that I disagree with her.
