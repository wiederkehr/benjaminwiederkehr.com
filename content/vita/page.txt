Lead:
My path has led me from studying Interaction Design, to actively practicing it in support of clients, to leading a team of designers and engineers. Today, I spend most of my time helping my team to create the best work of their careers in our studio. Connecting scientific research, applied practice, academic education, organizational design, and community engagement.

<h1 class="section-title">Vita</h1>
<h2 id="scroll-section-1">Practice</h2>
I am founding partner and managing director of (link:http://interactivethings.com text:Interactive Things), a design and technology studio established by Christian Siegrist, Jeremy Stucki, and myself in 2009. Today we lead the studio together with our partners Peter Gassner and Christoph Schmid. Interactive Things works at the intersection of science, technology, and design to help our clients to establish engaging and emotional interactions between them and their audience. The Zurich-based team currently consists of 12 multi-facetted designers and developers with backgrounds in Interaction Design, Information Design, Linguistics, Photography, Typography, Software Engineering and Data Science. Over the past eight years, our team has worked with national and international, private and public sector organizations of all sizes. Previous and current mandates include the Swiss Confederation, the German Cancellor’s Office, the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, National Geographic, Al Jazeera, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Swiss National Science Foundation, among others.

<h2 id="scroll-section-2">Research</h2>
Between 2005 and 2008, I have been studying the foundations of interaction design at the BA in Design program of the Zürich University of the Arts, earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Product Design with a specialization in Interaction Design. Between 2012 and 2014, I have been studying visual models and interaction patterns in exploratory tools for personal financial information under the supervision of Dr. Prof. Gerhard Buurman and Dr. Prof. Karmen Franinovic at the MA in Design program of the Zürich University of the Arts. I have taught modules or given lectures about interaction design and data visualization at the Zurich University of the Arts, UC Berkeley School of Information, Haute École de Géstion Geneva, Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, Università Iuav di Venezia, among others.

<h2 id="scroll-section-3">Writing</h2>
Beside my academic and professional work, I continue to engage in the national and international design community at large. Between 2009 and 2016, I published insights from our research and work process in the field of data and information visualization on (link:http://datavisualization.ch text:Datavisualization.ch). The website, and the social media ecosystem surrounding it, has attracted a combined following of over 40’000 people. Between 2011 and 2013, I conducted and published a series of interviews with a selection of today’s most influential thinkers and makers under the title (link:http://substratumseries.com text:Substratum Series).
